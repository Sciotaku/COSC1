# List of lists example

# Define a function that takes a list of lists as a parameter. Assume that inner lists have integers.
# The function should find the maximum element stored in any of the inner list.

# def max_in_lists(glist):
#     max_ele = glist[0][0]
#     for inner in glist:
#         for ele in inner:
#             if ele > max_ele:
#                 max_ele = ele
#
#     return max_ele
#
#
# mlist = [[13, 2], [23, -56, 87], [37, 27]]
# print(max_in_lists(mlist))

# Return the index of the maximum number in a list of lists
