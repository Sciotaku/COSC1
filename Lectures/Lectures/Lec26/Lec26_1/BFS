#Purpose: BFS pseudocode

Input: start and goal vertex
Output: Path

Frontier: deque
Backpointer dictionary

Algorithm:

1. Add the start vertex to frontier
2. Add the start vertex as key and value as None to backpointer dictionary
3. While Goal in not in backpointer and frontier is not empty:
4.      Get a vertex from frontier, let us call it curr_v
5.      for every neighbour adj_v  of curr_v:
6.          if adj_v is not in backpointer dictionary:
7.              Add adj_v to frontier
8.              Add adj_v as key and curr_v as value to backpointer dictionary
9.
10. v = Goal
11. initialize path to empty
12. while v != None:
13.     add v to path
14.     get the backpoint bp of v
15.     set v to bp
