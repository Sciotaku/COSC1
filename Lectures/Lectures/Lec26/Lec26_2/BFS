#Purpose: BFS pseudocode

Input: start and goal vertices
Output: Path from start to goal

Frontier: deque (Python collections)
Backpointer: dictionary

Algorithm

1. Add start vertex to frontier
2. Add start vertex as key with value as None to backpointer dictionary
3. while goal is not in backpointer and forntier is not empty:
4.       Get a vertex from frontier, call to curr_v
5.       for every adjacent vertex adj_v of curr_v
6.             if adj_v is not in backpointer:
7.                  Add adj_v to frontier
8.                  Add adj_v as key with value as curr_v to backpointer dictionary
9.
10. v = Goal
11. path is initialized to empty
12. while v != None:
13.     Add v to path
14.     get the backpointer of v from dictionary, call it bp
15.     change v to bp
